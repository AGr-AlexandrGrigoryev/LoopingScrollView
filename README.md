## Overview

This SwiftUI project provides an implementation of an infinite looping ScrollView for iOS 17. The `LoopingScrollView` allows users to create a horizontally scrolling view with a repeating pattern, giving the illusion of infinite content.

## Features

- Infinite scrolling for horizontally displayed content
- Customizable width, spacing, and content
- Utilizes SwiftUI for a clean and declarative syntax
- Compatible with iOS 17

## Example Usage

To use the `LoopingScrollView` in your SwiftUI project, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the `LoopingScrollView` in your SwiftUI view and provide the necessary parameters, such as width, spacing, and content.

## Parameters

- **width**: The width of each item in the scrolling view.
- **spacing**: The spacing between each item.
- **items**: A collection of identifiable items to display in the ScrollView.
- **content**: A closure defining the content of each item based on the provided collection.

## How It Works

The `LoopingScrollView` achieves infinite scrolling by adding the same set of items multiple times within the ScrollView. It intelligently adjusts the content offset during scrolling to give the appearance of a seamless loop.
